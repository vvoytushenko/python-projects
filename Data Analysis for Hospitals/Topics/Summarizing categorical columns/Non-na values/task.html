<html><body><p>You are working with a DataFrame called <code class="java">df_rock</code> that contains sonar signals from two object classes: rocks and mines. In the first five columns, you can see the wavelengths that the sonar got from different angles.</p>
<p>Load the given data as a <code class="java">pandas</code> Data Frame, then check how many non-NA values the <code class="java">"labels"</code> column has. You can use <code class="java">.count()</code> for that.</p>
<p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-471').style.display='inline'">
        Hint
      </button>
</p><div id="hint-471" style="display:none;"> The <code class="java">.loc</code> method can help you select the required column. </div>
<p>Please note: for now, when you go to the tab IDE, you can solve this problem only via Pycharm. We are sorry for the inconvenience, we will fix this as soon as we can. If you prefer to solve the problem via a different IDE, you should open it manually and then copy the solution to the website.</p></body></html><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">,0_deg,60_deg,90_deg,180_deg,240_deg,labels<br>0,0.740204,0.981484,0.605161,0.67712,NaN,<br>1,0.788051,0.68378,0.504151,0.713523,0.690165,M<br>2,NaN,0.668011,NaN,0.804288,0.713663,<br>3,0.560475,0.487072,0.103085,0.668011,0.805988,R<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">2</code></pre><br><br>
