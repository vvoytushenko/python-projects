<p>Examine the influence of LSB features on the IGL mean surface brightness with the <strong>one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)</strong>.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">The ANOVA test has conditions that must be fulfilled so that the associated <span class="math-tex">\(p\)</span>-value could be valid:

<ul>
<li>The samples must be independent;</li>
<li>Each sample is derived from a normally distributed population;</li>
<li>The variances of the groups are equal (the homogeneity of variances).</li>
</ul>
<p>For a good ANOVA test, we need to check the last two conditions</p></div>
<p>This project includes a lot of hypothesis testing. For intuitive understanding of this topic we highly recommend a set of 3 min videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRKtJ4IpxJpBxX2S9wXJUhB1_ha3ADFpF" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">stat thinking by Cassie Kozyrkov</a>ðŸš€</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, perform the following analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.shapiro.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the Shapiro-Wilk Normality test</a> for the IGL mean surface brightness (the <code class="java">mean_mu</code> column) in galaxies with LSB features and without them. This step is required to check the second condition of the ANOVA test: each sample came from a normally distributed population;</li>
<li>Perform <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.fligner.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the Fligner-Killeen Homogeneity test</a> for variances of the same two data samples. This is to check condition #3: the samples came from populations with equal variances.</li>
<li>Perform <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.f_oneway.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the one-way ANOVA test</a> and obtain a <span class="math-tex">\(p\)</span>-value. The null hypothesis of the test is that both groups (galaxies with LSB features and without them) are drawn from the populations with the same IGL mean surface brightness.</li>
<li>Print four floating-point numbers. Separate them with one space: two <span class="math-tex">\(p\)</span>-values for the Shapiro-Wilk test for galaxies with LSB features and without them, one <span class="math-tex">\(p\)</span>-value obtained from the Fligner-Killeen test, and one <span class="math-tex">\(p\)</span>-value of the ANOVA test.</li>
</ul>
