<h5 id="theory">Theory</h5>
<p>In this project, we will work with a dataset for astrophysics. It was designed for and by astrophysicists who study <strong>compact groups</strong> <strong>of galaxies </strong>(CGs), so it requires some explanation first. You will come across various terms, for example, the cosmological redshift, mean surface brightness of the intra-group light (IGL), galaxy low surface brightness (LSB) features, and so on. Don't worry, we will explain them to you as we go. Let's start!</p>
<ul>
<li>The<strong> apparent magnitude</strong> <span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span> of a star or any other source is a number that tells how bright it seems to us at its distance from the Earth. The scale is logarithmic and inverse. A larger magnitude corresponds to a fainter source. In our case, the surface brightness is quoted on a magnitude scale, in magnitudes per square arcsecond. Usually, the surface brightness in magnitudes per square arcsecond is denoted by the Greek letter <span class="math-tex">\(\mu\)</span>. For more information, refer to the great article <a href="https://www.learnthesky.com/blog/apparent-versus-absolute-magnitude" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Apparent versus Absolute Magnitude</a> by Learn the Sky.</li>
<li>A <strong>redshift</strong> is an increase in the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation. Caused solely by the expansion of the Universe, the value of the cosmological redshift indicates the distance to the object. As the Universe expands, it stretches light that travels through space in a cosmological redshift phenomenon. The greater the redshift, the greater the distance the light has traveled. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8ymm_1_ruw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Cosmological Redshift (YouTube)</a> video by Jason Kendall can shed more light on this.</li>
<li>The vast majority of stars in galaxy groups are within their constituent galaxies. However, a small fraction of stars is expected to follow the global dark matter potential of the group. These stars form an <strong>intra-group light </strong>(IGL)<strong> </strong>component.</li>
<li>Within the frame of the <strong>Lambda cold dark matter</strong> (ΛCDM) cosmological model, galaxy interactions play a major role in the hierarchical galaxy formation theory. The hierarchical structure formation paradigm requires that every galaxy undergoes interactions throughout its lifetime. We know that each interaction leaves visible signatures around galaxies in faint shells, tidal tails, halos, plumes, and stellar streams. These <strong>low surface brightness </strong>(LSB) features around galaxies encode the hierarchical nature of the cosmological structure formation. Modern LSB methods of observation can detect these features. To get a more complete picture of this field of astronomy, you can study this review article: <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200111067B/abstract" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Low Surface Brightness Universe</a>. Take a look at schematic images of various LSB features:</li>

<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>The dataset contains information about CGs. The <code class="java">Group</code> column displays the groups' names, <code class="java">z</code> indicates redshifts, <code class="java">mean_mu</code> states the IGL surface brightness, and the <code class="java">features</code> column includes information regarding LSB features – <code class="java">1</code> denotes the presence of LSB features for a CG, <code class="java">0</code> means no such features. Take a look at the sample:</p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Examine the box plot below for the mean surface brightness of the IGL in a group of compact groups of galaxies (CGs) with low surface brightness features and without them. Try to plot the same chart. Then find a mean redshift for these CGs.</p>
<p>As we've mentioned before, the magnitude system is inverse, so to place the brighter sources at the top, astronomers usually invert the magnitude axis.</p>

<p>To complete this stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the following dataset: <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/665342/groups.tsv" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">groups.tsv</a>. TSV stands for tab-separated values. Use the <code class="java">pandas.read_csv</code> method and specify the <code class="java">delimiter</code> parameter;</li>
<li>Remove the missing values from the dataset, you can use the <code class="java">dropna</code> function;</li>
<li>Find a mean value for the IGL mean surface brightness in groups of galaxies with LSB features and without them;</li>
<li>Print two floating-point numbers (the mean value of the mean surface brightness for galaxies with LSB features and without them) split with a space.</li>
</ul>
