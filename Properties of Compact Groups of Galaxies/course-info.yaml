title: Properties of Compact Groups of Galaxies
language: English
summary: <p>Most galaxies in the Universe are found as highly-dense groups or clusters.
  The densest and the most populous are galaxy clusters;&nbsp;they may contain 50+
  relatively bright galaxies in the area of a few megaparsecs. The smaller aggregations
  are called groups and compact groups (CGs).&nbsp;CGs are of particular interest
  for studying galaxy merging and the properties of interacting galaxies. This project
  presents an opportunity to be an astrophysicist. Discover interesting properties
  of compact groups with the statistical methods of Python. Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re
  completely new to the field of astrophysics; we&#39;ve explained all the important
  concepts in the project body and provided you with the tips that will help you navigate.&nbsp;</p><br/><br/>Learn
