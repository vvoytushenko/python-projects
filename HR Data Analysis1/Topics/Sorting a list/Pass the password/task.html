<h2>Pass the password</h2>
<html><body><p>Tim chooses a password for social networks so that it be difficult to crack. He wrote down the options in a list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-profile">passwords = ['0vbno0re', 'ad12', 'fgghut', '4qp', 'qwerty']</code></pre>
<p>Now, he wants to determine the level of their security depending on the length. A password that has a length of 1 is the most unsafe one, while a password of length 10 is considered the best one.</p>
<p>Given a list of passwords, sort them from the least safe to the safest one. As the output, print all  passwords together with their length. For the example above, you should print:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">4qp 3
ad12 4
fgghut 6
qwerty 6
0vbno0re 8</code></pre></body></html><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
