<h2>Can’t sort my list!</h2>
<p>Nathan has a list that contains the names of all his friends. He wants to sort it in alphabetical order and then print it. However, when he executes this code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">my_list = ['Mary', 'Bob', 'Pete', 'Jane']
my_list = my_list.sort()
print(my_list)</code></pre>

<p>only <em>None</em> is printed! Help him – find a broken line in his code, fix it and write down the corrected line.</p>

<p><button
        class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary"
        onclick="getElementById('hint-426').style.display='inline'">
        Hint
      </button>
      <div id="hint-426" style="display:none;">Write only the line that you corrected and not the whole code!</div></p>
