<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>The HR boss wants to delve into the metrics of the two employee groups: those who left the company and those who still work for us. You decided to present the information in a table. Use <code class="java">groupby()</code> and <code class="java">agg()</code> to generate a DataFrame with metrics.</p>
<p>The HR boss asks for the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>the median number of projects the employees in a group worked upon, and how many employees worked on more than five projects;</li>
<li>the mean and median time spent in the company;</li>
<li>the share of employees who've had work accidents;</li>
<li>the mean and standard deviation of the last evaluation score</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that the guy from HR asks for those metrics for two different groups! Output the resulting DataFrame as a dictionary.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Steps 1-7 are the same as steps from the previous stage. This stage requires completing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load all three datasets. Remember, data is stored in the <em>XML</em> format;</li>
<li>Explore the data â€” check the axes, get the shapes of the DataFrames, use <code class="java">df.info()</code> to check whether there are null values and review the data types;</li>
<li>Reindex all three datasets in the same way as in the previous stage;</li>
<li>Use the <code class="java">concat()</code> function from <code class="java">pandas</code> to generate a unified dataset for offices A and B;</li>
<li>Use <code class="java">df.merge()</code> to carry out the left merging of the unified office dataset with HR's dataset. Merge both datasets by index. For the final table, leave only those employees whose data is contained in both datasets. Set <code class="java">indicator=True</code> in <code class="java">df.merge()</code>;</li>
<li>Drop the <code class="java">employee_office_id</code>, <code class="java">employee_id</code> columns and the column that contains a row source;</li>
<li>Sort the final dataset by index;</li>
<li>Write the <code class="java">count_bigger_5</code> function that counts the number of employees who worked on more than five projects. You will then use it in the <code class="java">agg()</code> method to calculate the metric from the first point in the Description section;</li>
<li>Generate a table according to the boss's needs. Round all the numbers to two decimals. To round numbers to the second decimal place, you can apply the <code class="java">round(2)</code> method to a DataFrame;</li>
<li>Print the resulting table as a Python dictionary. To do so, use the <code class="java">to_dict()</code> method.</li>
</ol>
